- y-axis: the new infections in the last 7 days 
- x-axis: the overall infections until the day
- reference line in dashed black showes exponential growth
- as long as the line of one country follows this line, they stay in the range of exponentiell growing infection rates
- important to look at this slides as a sequence of days to see the traveling of the countries and make conclusions of the behaivior to the given date


# confirmed_cases_of_germany and confirmed_cases_of_united_states

- y-axis: the new infections in the last 7 days 
- x-axis: the overall infections until the day
- no logarithmic scale to negate the underestimation of the logarithmic scale in the trajectory plot
- gives context to the trajectory graph
- new conclusion in the trajectory graph can can be taken into focus without underestimation
